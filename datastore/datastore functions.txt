Datastore functions


Brief explanation
A lot of these functions take a uid. This does not need to be sent by the client
in some cases. The server is able to use Google's user service to get the user
object of the currently signed in user. One of the fields of the user object
is the user_id.

Some of the functions return a python dictionary that can contain an error message.
These are only error messages related to a problem with the passed in values,
for example if a username has already been taken. The other case is when a Jingle
cannot be edited because the service is busy. The error message can be sent back
to the client to describe the problem to them.

            called when the user uid wants to start editing the jingle jid
            
            returns a python dictionary. If there was an error:
                {"errorMessage" : errorMessage}
            or on success:
                {"token" : token}

        requestNewToken(jid, oldToken)
            called via a request from the client when they notice that their token has expired.
            takes the id of the jingle the client was editing and the old token which must now be removed
            from the relevant JinglrMap.
            returns a fresh token which can be used by the client
            
        stopEditing(jid, channelToken)                                                                  **DONE**

            doesn't return anything. Remember, we are expecting the clients to press the
            close button so we will be lucky if the client gets to call stopEditing
            
            
Non blocking writes
    
    
    submitAction(jid, action)										**DONE**

	this submits a json update action to be processed by the server. The action gets added to
    	a task queue to do later, and the function returns.
    
   	It takes an action which is a python dictionary, and the song ID
    
    	it doesn't return anything but once the action has been completed it will be sent down
    	the channels
