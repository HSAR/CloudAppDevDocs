data is stored in so called entities

entities have unique keys

entities can have parent entities

parent entities have child entities

form a structure similar to a file system

An entity's parent, parent's parent, and so on recursively, are its ancestors

its children, children's children, and so on, are its descendants

a root entity has no parent

Entities descended from a common ancestor are said to belong to the same entity group

the common ancestor's key is the group's parent key, which serves to identify the entire group

Queries over a single entity group, called ancestor queries, refer to the parent key instead of a specific entity's key

Entity groups are a unit of both consistency and transactionality

queries over multiple entity groups may return stale, eventually consistent results

those limited to a single entity group always return up-to-date, strongly consistent results.

write rate to a single entity group should be limited to ~1 per second
