End Point problems?

	song get only returns the json tune part, not things like title and all that

	StateDump is acting like an action but it's not. This will be more like song get if not exactly the same

	UserSongsHandler - using json.dumps on a list of jingle entities

	UserCollabsHandler - using json.dumps on a list of jingle entities

	UserInvitesHandler - using json.dumps on a list of jingle entities

	should do a permissions check on BeginEditing


Still need lots more end points:
	getting collaborators on a particular jingle
	
	searching jingles? not sure what the status on this actually is

	creating a user

	update username

	update bio

	update tags (user)

	add collab invite

	answer collab invite

	remove collab


	create jingle

	change title

	change genre

	change tags (jingle)

A few of these are "social" features that Sam has already mentioned


Other completely different things:
	sort out with Mark how we are going to get the number of bars

	sort out if when changing the sub divisions we will also alter the note positions and lengths to take account of it

	more permissions

	request new token when a users current token expires


Permisions
	anyone can get a user by username or UID

	at the momement we will let anyone see a list of the users songs or songs they are collaborating on
		this would be different if we were going to add the functionality for private and public songs but it's just adding more features

	anyone can get a jingle

	anyone can get the collaborators on a jingle

	anyone can search jingles

	anyone can create a user

	only a user can update their bio, tags, username and answer their collab invites 

	when adding a collab invite
		only the owner of the jingle can add a collaborator to it

	when removing a collab
		users can only remove themselves from collaborating on a jingle OR
		jingle authors can remove any collaborator from it

	only registered users can create jingles

	only the jingle author can change the jingle title, genre, tags or the song itself

	only a user who is allowed to edit a jingle is allowed to get a token for editing on it
