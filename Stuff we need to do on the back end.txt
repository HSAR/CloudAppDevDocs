End Point problems?

	UserSongsHandler - using json.dumps on a list of jingle entities

	UserCollabsHandler - using json.dumps on a list of jingle entities

	UserInvitesHandler - using json.dumps on a list of jingle entities
    
    db_to_dict doesn't seem to work


Still need lots more end points:
	getting collaborators on a particular jingle
	
	searching jingles? not sure what the status on this actually is

	add collab invite

	answer collab invite

	remove collab


	create jingle

	change title

	change genre

	change tags (jingle)
    
    requesting a new token

A few of these are "social" features that Sam has already mentioned


Other completely different things:

	sort out if when changing the sub divisions we will also alter the note positions and lengths to take account of it

	more permissions
    
    at the moment from looking at the logs it seems songs/token is being called without actually making a channel out
    of it on the client side which means it is never connected which means it never gets disconnected. Also, in these cases 
    it is called twice immediately next to each other which can't be right
    

Permissions
	anyone can get a user by username or UID

	at the moment we will let anyone see a list of the users songs or songs they are collaborating on
		this would be different if we were going to add the functionality for private and public songs but it's just adding more features

	anyone can get a jingle

	anyone can get the collaborators on a jingle

	anyone can search jingles

	anyone can create a user

	only a user can update their bio, tags, username and answer their collab invites 

	when adding a collab invite
		only the owner of the jingle can add a collaborator to it

	when removing a collab
		users can only remove themselves from collaborating on a jingle OR
		jingle authors can remove any collaborator from it

	only registered users can create jingles

	only the jingle author can change the jingle title, genre or tags
    
    jingle authors and collaborators can edit the jingle tune

	only a user who is allowed to edit a jingle is allowed to get a token for editing on it
        both begin editing and request new token
