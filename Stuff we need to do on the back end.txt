Review "get all users" code structure - true/false for arbitrary field limitations is... not that great.

    Suggest we pass in an array of desired fields e.g. ["username", "uid"] which will be what are passed out

Other completely different things:

    at the moment from looking at the logs it seems songs/token is being called without actually making a channel out
    of it on the client side which means it is never connected which means it never gets disconnected. Also, in these cases 
    it is called twice immediately next to each other which can't be right
